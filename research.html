In this paper, we show that when policy-motivated parties can commit to a particular platform during a uni-dimensional electoral contest where valence issues do not arise there must be a positive association between the policies preferred by candidates and the policies adopted in expectation in the lowest and the highest equilibria of the electoral contest. We also show that this need not be so if the parties cannot commit to a particular policy. The implication is that evidence of a negative relationship between enacted and preferred policies is suggestive of parties that hold positions from which they would like to move from yet are unable to do so. <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/40505">Economic Theory Bulletin</a>, 10, 2022.</p>

This paper presents the Inclusive Green Energy index to evaluate the progress in achieving the key dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goal 7, which entails ensuring access to affordable, sustainable and modern energy for all. The key aspects of this index are: (i) it focuses on the change of the corresponding variables, rather than on their levels; (ii) it exhibits a decomposability feature that permits integrating several dimensions in a simple way, allowing for the inclusion of goods and bads; and (iii) the evaluation of progress is made relative to some reference values (targets and thresholds) that can differ between countries. We calculate the Inclusive Green Energy index of progress for 183 countries using data from 2000 to 2014 on three indicators intended to capture inclusiveness, greenness, and efficiency regarding energy use. The results show that progress has, on average, been positive across the world, with more than 88 per cent of the sample of countries experiencing some degree of progress. However, progress is smaller for the Middle East and North African and Sub-Saharan African countries and it is negative for most of the countries that exhibit low levels of human development, as measured by the Human Development Index. Furthermore, fewer than one in four of the countries in the sample have an IGE commensurate with having met their respective country-level targets. This suggests that much remains to be done by almost all countries worldwide with regard to being on track towards meeting their Sustainable Development Goal 7 by 2030. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920311879">Applied Energy</a>, 279, December, 2020.</p>

In this paper I prove a theorem that establishes bounds on the marginal rate of substitution between losing $x and winning $y, starting from wealth level $w for a risk averse individual that rejects a small stake gamble for a range of initial wealth levels. I am then able to prove a theorem that can identify the kinds of large stakes that would be rejected by any such individual. The theorems allow us to understand how much risk aversion is embedded in anyone&rsquo;s rejections of certain small stakes gambles and provide tighter connections between the results in Rabin (2000) and the received theory of decision making under risk. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.108899">Economics Letters</a>, 187, February 2020.</p>

An Inclusive Green Economy is one that provides a response to three sets of challenges currently facing humanity: persistent poverty, overstepped planetary boundaries and inequitable sharing of growing prosperity.   In this paper we identify some basic desiderata that any inclusive green economy measurement framework ought to satisfy; survey the existing initiatives aimed at tracking whether an economy is green, inclusive, and sustainable; and provide an example of what a green economy measurement framework that satisfies the basic desiderata can look like in practice.

In this paper we show how two seemingly irrelevant accounting principles for central banks -the choice of the unit of account for its balance sheet and the method of inventory valuation of foreign currency reserves- can overstate or understate profits transferred to the treasury and how this can threaten the ability of central banks to control inflation. We show the first point through Monte Carlo experiments calibrated for the Venezuelan economy and the second point in an infinitely lived representative agent model that illustrates the problem of the joint determination of the level of central bank assets and the size of profits transferred to the treasury when the objective of the central bank is to eliminate the possibility of a hyperinflation.</span> <a href="http://economia.lacea.org/contents.htm">Econom&iacute;a</a>, 18(2), Spring, 2018.</p>

Ravallion (2012a) argues that the Human Development Index (HDI) embeds questionable tradeoffs between the dimensions used to compute the index. To alleviate these problems he proposes the adoption of one of the indices developed by Chakravarty (2003). In this paper I identify the following paradox: while the Chakravarty indices clearly exhibit more sensible tradeoffs than the HDI, the HDI produces more sensible rankings than the Chakravarty indices. To solve the paradox I identify the axioms behind each methodology responsible for the unintuitive tradeoffs and rankings and illustrate how to develop an index with these questionable axioms removed. This approach can result in methodologies that exhibit more intuitive tradeoffs by design, as it seeks inputs from the public as to what those tradeoffs ought to be, and produces rankings that are more in line with what the HDI wishes to measure: human development and capabilities, as conceptualized by Sen (1985). <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1475-4991">Review of Income and Wealth</a>, 63(3), September, 2017.</p>

Many people object to the creation of a market for kidneys on the grounds that such reform would hurt those patients unable to afford the market price of a kidney and that donors do not understand the risks they&rsquo;re taking when donating.  In this paper, we propose a mechanism, the kidney co-operative, designed to provide sufficient incentives to alleviate the kidney shortage while at the same time addressing the concerns regarding the potential losers from reform. We show that it is reasonable to expect that the number of transplants will be larger under the kidney co-operative mechanism than under either the status quo or a conventional market mechanism. <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2390352">Journal of Health Economics</a>, 54, July, 2017.</p>

In this paper I provide a solution to Proebsting&rsquo;s Paradox, an argument that appears to show that the investment rule known as the Kelly criterion can lead a decision maker to invest a higher fraction of his wealth the more unfavorable the odds he faces are and, as a consequence, risk an arbitrarily high proportion of his wealth on the outcome of a single event. I show that a large class of investment criteria, including &rsquo;fractional Kelly,&rsquo; also suffer from the same shortcoming and adapt ideas from the literature on price discrimination and surplus extraction to explain why this is so. I also derive a new criterion, dubbed the doubly conservative criterion, that is immune to the problem identified above. Immunity stems from the investor&rsquo;s attitudes towards capital preservation and from him becoming rapidly pessimistic about his chances of winning the better odds he is offered.</span> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304406813000724">Journal of Mathematical Economics</a>, 52, 2014.</p>

In 2010 the UNDP unveiled a new methodology for the calculation of the <em>Human Development Index</em> (HDI). In this paper I investigate the normative and practical properties of this change vis a vis the original formulation of the HDI in 1990. The main conceptual innovation of the new index can be summarized as follows: the new HDI penalizes both low and uneven achievements across all dimensions of human development, whereas the old formulation is not sensitive to such uneven development.  In practice, however, both methodologies agree considerably in terms of how they rank countries, but when they differ, the new methodology produces results more consistent with what the HDI is intended to measure: <em>human development and capabilities</em>, as conceptualized by Sen (1985). <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-013-0756-9">Social Choice and Welfare</a>,<em>42(4), 20</em>14.</p>

Economists currently favor arguments in favor of Central Bank independence based on Barro-Gordon (1983 a,b), a very &lsquo;orthodox&rsquo; model. Consequently, those who view the economic orthodoxy with suspicion tend to question Central Bank independence. I argue that Central Bank independence can be beneficial even in a very &lsquo;structuralist&rsquo; economy: one in which workers are unionized, firms are cartelized and inflation arises as the result of distributive struggles among capitalists and workers. This is so because it is the time-inconsistency issue, and not the structure of the economy, that which generates the inflation bias that Central Bank independence is set to eliminate. <a href="http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2014/Volume34/EB-14-V34-I4-P200.pdf">Economics Bulletin</a>, 34  (4), 2014. </p>

With Amie Gaye, Jeni Klugman, Milorad Kovacevic and Sarah Twigg. Gender inequality remains a major barrier to human development. Girls and women have made major strides since 1990, but they have not yet gained gender equity. In this paper, we review ways to measure and monitor gender inequality, providing a critique of existing measures including the first global gender indices that were launched in the 1995 Human Development Report &ndash; the Gender-related Development Index and the Gender Empowerment Measure - and introduce a new index that is presented in the 2010 Human Development Report. The Gender Inequality Index, which addresses the key criticisms of previous measures, is unique in including critical issues of educational attainment, economic and political participation, and reproductive health issues and in accounting for overlapping inequalities at the national level. As such, it represents an important advance on existing global measures of gender equity. Measures of the disadvantages for women raise awareness of problems, permit monitoring of progress towards gender equity objectives and help keep governments accountable. In this light, the Gender Inequality Index is designed to reveal the extent to which the realization of a country&rsquo;s human development potential is curtailed by gender inequality, and provides empirical foundations for policy analysis and advocacy efforts. We also compare our results with the results of alternative gender inequality indices, finding significant variation in rankings across the various indices due largely to differences in the elements of gender inequality they seek to measure.

In this paper I show that, just as with Nash Equilibrium, there are sparse conditions, not involving common knowledge of rationality, that lead to (correlated) rationalizability. The basic observation is that, if the actual world belongs to a set of states where the set Z of action profiles is played, each player knows her own payoffs, everyone is rational and it is mutual knowledge that the action profiles played are in Z, then the actions played at the actual world are rationalizable actions. Alternatively, if at the actual world the support of the conjecture of player i is Di, there is mutual knowledge of: (i) the game being played, (ii) that the players are rational, and (iii) that for every i the support of the conjecture of player i is contained in Di, then every strategy in the support of the conjectures is rationalizable. The results do not require common knowledge of anything, are valid for games with any number of players, and extend to refinements of rationalizability such as independent rationalizability and rationalizable conjectural equilibrium. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089982560700156X">Games and Economic Behavior</a>, 63(1), 2008. </p>

        I show that the predictive content of the hypothesis of subjective expected
        utility maximization critically depends on what the analyst knows about
        the details of the problem a particular decision maker faces. When the
        analyst does not know anything about the agent&acute;s payoffs or beliefs
        and can only observe the sequence of actions taken by the decision maker
        any arbitrary sequence of actions can be implemented as the choice of
        an agent that solves some intertemporal utility maximization problem under

        Form</a>. When evaluating the rationality of a player in an epistemic
        model of a noncooperative game one has to examine counterfactuals such
        as "what would happen if the player were to do what he actually does
        not do?" In this paper I develop an epistemic model of a normal form
        game where counterfactuals of this sort are evaluated as in the philosophical
        literature (cf. Lewis, 1973; Stalnaker , 1968). According to this method
        one evaluates a statement like "what would the player believe if he were
        to do what he actually does not do" at the world that is closest to the
        actual world in which the hypothetical deviation actually occurs. I show
        that, in this extended model, common knowledge of rationality need not
        lead to rationalizability. I also present assumptions that allow rationalizability
        to be a consequence of common knowledge of rationality in this extended
        model. These assumptions suggest that it may be misleading to believe
        that, from an epistemic point of view, rationalizability relies on weaker
        assumptions about belief consistency than Nash equilibrium. <a href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bejte.2004.4.1/bejte.2004.4.1.1020/bejte.2004.4.1.1020.xml" name="

        between individuals in which one does as indicated by another what he
        or she would not do in the absence of such indication. With this as background,
        the article presents the " pre-modern " notions of authority developed
        by Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli and Weber; and then the perspective
        given by Arendt, according to which these notions are grounded in an
        ontological tradition whose time has past. This leads to the point of
        view of Lukes, according to which it is unavoidable that multiple perspectives
        exist in the understanding of authority. These perspectives are associated
        with the different degrees of solidity that one can give to social composites
        such as culture, language, social groups, and the individual itself. 
        The article then presents the perspectives of Friedman, Flathman,
        Raz and Zambrano. They reveal that the authority relation is as solid
        as the beliefs that justify individual choices that, at the interpreted
        level, are labeled as "ruling" and "following". The article concludes
        by pointing out how our understanding of the authority relation may change

        ( With Tim Vogelsang ) Werner Hildenbrand formulated in 1994 a hypothesis
        that we call the Natural Time Law of Demand , namely , that for any two
        time periods t and t' the vector of prices pt and the vector of demands
        Qt may be related by (pt - pt')(Qt - Qt') &lt; 0. In this paper we
        formulate a related hypothesis , the Homogeneous Law of Demand , which
        is the Natural Time Law of Demand for income - normalized prices . We
        test both hypotheses for the United States by using time series techniques
        and conclude that both hypotheses are consistent with the data. Importantly
        , the Homogeneous Law of Demand is equivalent to the Law of Demand if
        the distribution of income varies slowly relative to the speed at which
        aggregate income changes over time. Under such assumption we strongly
        reject the hypothesis that the Law of Demand fails to hold for the United

        Talcot Parsons suggested in 1963 that there are basically three kinds
        of authority: utilitarian authority, coercive authority, and persuasive
        authority. In this paper I show that the models developed by Gibbons
        and Rutten (1997), Hirshleifer (1991), Skaperdas (1992), Akerlof (1976)
        and Basu (1986) can be viewed as models where issues such as authority,
        power, influence and ideology, in the sense of Parsons, can be formally
        discussed. I also show the existence of an interesting difficulty in
        providing a contractarian interpretation of the State under the Parsonian
        view of governmental authority discussed in this paper. <a href="http://rss.sagepub.com/content/11/2/115.abstract" name="Rationality and Society">

		<strong class="titles"><a name="6"></a>On the Emergence of the Market Pattern</strong>. I examine the work of Karl Polanyi (The Great Transformation, 1944) to extract from it hypotheses related to the emergence and operation of the capitalist system. I adapt models from the literature on complex adaptive systems and evolutionary game theory to build a fictitious society in which I "test" those hypotheses. The results are encouraging: the model provides functional insight on the relationship between the commoditization of labor and the emergence of a self equilibrating market economy. <a href="http://www.mohr.de/jite.html" name="Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics">Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics </a> 154(3), September, 1998. </p>

In this paper I develop a normative framework for the design of a measure of human development that contains the UNDP&rsquo;s Human Development Index (HDI) as a special case. The methodology allows for the collection of information from the public about what tradeoffs between the core variables one ought to find acceptable in the determination of the index while remaining broadly in line with what the HDI wishes to measure: human development and capabilities, as conceptualized by Sen (1985). </p>

For  each individual with von Neumann and Morgernstern&rsquo;s preferences and for each  gamble that can take negative values yet has positive <em>expected value</em> we calculate separately the reservation values of  the losses and of the gains of the gamble and denote those values by <span style="font-family:courier new;">risk<sup>*</sup></span> and<span style="font-family:courier new;"> reward</span>, respectively. In this paper we show the connection between these numbers and  the <em>certainty equivalent</em> of a gamble,  explain how the <span style="font-family:courier new;">(risk<sup>*</sup></span>, <span style="font-family:courier new;">reward</span>) pair  paints a richer picture about the risk and return characteristics of that  gamble to that individual than the one obtained from the (<em>risk premium</em>, <em>expected value</em>)  profile, and argue that the resulting risk<sup>*</sup> measure is a more  accurate measure of <em>risk of loss</em> than  those that arise from strict considerations of <em>first </em>and<em> second order stochastic  dominance</em>.</p>
